Including:
- 2 small libraries: Settings.php (for storing basic settings data in DB, with a simple cache mechanism (easy extendable by external cache class) and Cache.php (for flexible caching a extended
data structures using registered cache engine in Zend). Full documentated with phpDoc's!
- js file used by controller/action with jQuery functions
- one of my Zend controller. As you see there is only a basic code and other operations are processes in Model_***App classes. That should always be done like that. That's some "extended" MVC model - extended be other layer responsible of data flow with common function for operations all over the application. This way I dont need to write (or copy&past) the code responsible for saving data in multiple places - I have one common function. If something goes wrong I have only one place where my fixing work is focused :)
